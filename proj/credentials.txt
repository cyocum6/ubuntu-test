     (carried over from iottempcloud2 I think, cloud2 now Stopped)
  MySQL may need table deleted using database = finaltemp, table = temp
     more info, see README.md
     local 2FA implemented so password no longer needed

QEMU:
  buildroot local user: iottemp 
  buildroot local password: zxcv
    (will not carry forward for deployment on hardware as local QEMU/buildroot only)
    tester needs to use own QEMU installation with own password 
    S80tcsimd file will auto start when properly installed, no user/pw needed
